I've been working for more than 15 years as a marketing data analyst for various financial institutions.  
I use SAS, R, and Python for statistical modelling like machine learning, web crawling, and text mining.  
I got master degree in Database Marketing in 2002, and I'm looking for more chance to learn about AI.
